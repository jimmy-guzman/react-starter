## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You can either [use this template](https://github.com/jimmy-guzman/react-starter/generate) or [deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjimmy-guzman%2Freact-starter&project-name=my-awesome-react-project&repository-name=my-awesome-react-project) or use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), by running the following command:

```
degit jimmy-guzman/react-starter
```

## üèÅ Getting Started

Make sure you're using [node 20](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases), I recommend using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) which will allow you to simply run:

```
fnm use
```

First install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), by running the following command:

```
pnpm install
```

And to download new browsers for Playwright, run the following command:

```
pnpm exec playwright install
```

Then to run the development server, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at http://localhost:5173/ ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üí° Recommendations

If you need to do more, I recommend the following libraries:

- [TanStack Query (React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/overview) for **data management** which will take care of fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state for you
  - [msw](https://mswjs.io) for when you start testing your data integrations
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for when you need **client side routing**
- [jotai](https://jotai.org) for when you don't want to use context for **state management** or need more state management outside of React Query
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for when you need more **state management** outside of React Query or jotai if you wen that route
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) for when you need to build **forms**
- [TanStack Table (React Table)](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) for when you need to build complex **tables** or **data grids**
- [fathom](https://usefathom.com) for **analytics** which is easy to use
