You can either [use this template](https://github.com/jimmy-guzman/react-starter/generate) or [deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjimmy-guzman%2Freact-starter&project-name=my-awesome-react-project&repository-name=my-awesome-react-project) or use [tiged](https://github.com/tiged/tiged), by running the following command:

## 🏁 Getting Started

First install [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), by running the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

Now you can install dependencies, by running the following command:

Or if you already have `bun` installed you upgrade, by running the following command:

 bun upgrade --stable
```

And to download new browsers for Playwright, run the following command:

bunx playwright install
```

Then to run the development server, run the following command:

Your application will be available at http://localhost:5173/ ❤️

## 💡 Recommendations

If you need to do more, I recommend the following libraries:

- [jotai](https://jotai.org) for when you don't want to use context for **state management** or need more state management outside of React Query
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for when you need more **state management** outside of React Query or jotai if you wen that route
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) for when you need to build **forms**
- [TanStack Table (React Table)](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) for when you need to build complex **tables** or **data grids**
- [fathom](https://usefathom.com) for **analytics** which is easy to use
